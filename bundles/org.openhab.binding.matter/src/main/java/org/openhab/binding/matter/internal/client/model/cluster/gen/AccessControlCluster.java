NOTE The Proxy View privilege is provisional.
Each privilege builds upon its predecessor, expanding the set of actions that can be performed upon a Node. Administer is the highest privilege, and is special as it pertains to the administration of privileges itself, via the Access Control Cluster.
When a Node is granted a particular privilege, it is also implicitly granted all logically lower privilege levels as well. The following diagram illustrates how the higher privilege levels subsume the lower privilege levels:
Figure 43. Access Control Privilege Levels
Individual clusters shall define whether attributes are readable, writable, or both readable and writable. Clusters also shall define which privilege is minimally required to be able to perform a particular read or write action on those attributes, or invoke particular commands. Device type specifications may further restrict the privilege required.
The Access Control Cluster shall require the Administer privilege to observe and modify the Access Control Cluster itself. The Administer privilege shall NOT be used on Access Control Entries which use the Group auth mode.

Device types may impose additional constraints on the minimum number of subjects per Access Control Entry.
An attempt to create an entry with more subjects than the node can support shall result in a RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED error and the entry shall NOT be created.
### Subject ID shall be of type uint64 with semantics depending on the entry’s AuthMode as follows:
Subject Semantics
An empty subjects list indicates a wildcard; that is, this entry shall grant access to any Node that successfully authenticates via AuthMode. The subjects list shall NOT be empty if the entry’s AuthMode is PASE.
The PASE AuthMode is reserved for future use (see Section 6.6.2.8, “Bootstrapping of the Access Control Cluster”). An attempt to write an entry with AuthMode set to PASE shall fail with a status code of CONSTRAINT_ERROR.
For PASE authentication, the Passcode ID identifies the required passcode verifier, and shall be 0 for the default commissioning passcode.
For CASE authentication, the Subject ID is a distinguished name within the Operational Certificate shared during CASE session establishment, the type of which is determined by its range to be one of:
  • a Node ID, which identifies the required source node directly (by ID)
  • a CASE Authenticated Tag, which identifies the required source node indirectly (by tag)
For Group authentication, the Group ID identifies the required group, as defined in the Group Key Management Cluster.
