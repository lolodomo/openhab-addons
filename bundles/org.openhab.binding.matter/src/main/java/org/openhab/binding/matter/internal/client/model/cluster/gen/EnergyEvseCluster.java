This field is based on local wall clock time. In case of Daylight Savings Time transition which may result in an extra hour or one hour less in the day, the charging algorithm should take into account the shift appropriately.
Note that if the TargetTimeMinutesPastMidnight values are too close together (e.g. 2 per day) these may overlap. The EVSE may have to coalesce the charging targets into a single target. e.g. if the 1st charging target cannot be met in the time available, the EVSE may be forced to begin working towards the 2nd charging target and immediately continue until both targets have been satisfied (or the vehicle becomes full).
The EVSE itself cannot predict the behavior of the vehicle (i.e. if it cannot obtain the SoC from the vehicle), so should attempt to perform a sensible operation based on these targets. It is recommended that the charging schedule is pessimistic (i.e. starts earlier) since the vehicle may charge more slowly than the electrical supply may provide power (especially if it is cold).
If the user configures large charging targets (e.g. high values of AddedEnergy or SoC) then it is expected that the EVSE may need to begin charging immediately, and may not be able to guarantee that the vehicle will be able to reach the target.

This represents a positive value in mWh that SHOULD be added during the session (i.e. if the vehicle charging is stopped and started several times, this equates to the total energy since the vehicle has been plugged in).
The maximum value (500kWh) is much larger than most EV batteries on the market today. If the client tries to set this value too high then the EVSE will need to start charging immediately and continue charging until the vehicle stops demanding charge (i.e. it is full). Therefore the maximum value should be set based on typical battery size of the vehicles on the market (e.g. 70000Wh), however this is up to the client to carefully choose a value.
NOTE
If the EVSE can obtain the Battery Capacity of the vehicle, it SHOULD not limit this AddedEnergy value to the Battery Capacity of the vehicle, since the EV may also require energy for heating and cooling of the battery during charging, or for heating or cooling the cabin.

This range requirement can be converted into a daily energy demand with a target charging completion time.
The EVSE itself may use this information (or may allow a controller such as an EMS) to compute an
optimized charging schedule.
An EVSE device may implement the Device Energy Management cluster PFR (Power Forecast Reporting) and FA (Forecast Adjustment) features. This can help a controller (such as an EMS) to optimize the EVSE against other ESAs. For example, a solar PV ESA may share its Forecast and allow the EVSE to know the best time to charge so that any excess solar generation is used to charge the EV.
EVSE devices that support the Device Energy Management cluster’s FA feature can have their charging profiles set by a controller device such as an EMS. For example, if the EVSE advertises a simple power forecast which allows the EMS to adjust over a wide range of power and time durations, then the EVSE may allow the EMS to propose a revised optimized forecast (which is the charging profile).
