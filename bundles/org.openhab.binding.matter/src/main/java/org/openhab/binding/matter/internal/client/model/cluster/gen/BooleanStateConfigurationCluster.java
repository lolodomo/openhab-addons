This is intended to stop visual and/or audible alarms, when the user has become aware that the sensor is triggered, but it is no longer desired to have the alarm modes active on the device, e.g.:
  • The triggering cause have been resolved by the user, but the sensor has not yet stopped     detecting the triggering cause.
  • The user is not able to address the triggering cause, but is aware of the alarm and     suppress/acknowledge it be addressed at a later point.
Acknowledge of alarms will for the remainder of this cluster be referred to as suppress.
A suppressed alarm is still considered active and will remain so unless it is actively disabled or the triggering condition is not longer present. The action of suppressing an alarm mode is only applicable to and is intended to stop the physical alarming, e.g. emitting a sound or blinking a light; it does not impact alarm reporting in AlarmsActive.
