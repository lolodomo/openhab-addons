  1.4.7.3.2. ValueUnsigned8, ValueSigned8, ValueUnsigned16, ValueSigned16, ValueUnsigned32,              ValueSigned32, ValueUnsigned64, ValueSigned64 Fields
These fields shall indicate the attribute value as part of an extension field set, associated with a given AttributeID under an ExtensionFieldSetStruct’s ClusterID. The proper field shall be present that maps to the data type of the attribute indicated.
  • Data types bool, map8, and uint8 shall map to ValueUnsigned8.
  • Data types int8 shall map to ValueSigned8.
  • Data types map16 and uint16 shall map to ValueUnsigned16.
  • Data types int16 shall map to ValueSigned16.
  • Data types map32, uint24, and uint32 shall map to ValueUnsigned32.
  • Data types int24 and int32 shall map to ValueSigned32.
  • Data types map64, uint48, uint56 and uint64 shall map to ValueUnsigned64.
  • Data types int48, int56 and int64 shall map to ValueSigned64.
  • For nullable attributes, any value that is not a valid numeric value for the attribute’s type     after accounting for range reductions due to being nullable and constraints shall be considered     to have the null value for the type.
  • For non-nullable attributes, any value that is not a valid numeric value for the attribute’s     type after accounting for constraints shall be considered to have the maximum legal value in     the attribute’s constrained range.
Examples of processing are:
  • ColorControl cluster CurrentX (AttributeID 0x0003) has a type of uint16 and is not nullable.
    ◦ AttributeValue of 0xAB12 would be used as-is, as it is in range.
    ◦ AttributeValue of 0xAA0011 is outside of the range of uint16, and would be saturated to the       maximum of the attribute’s constraint range: 0xFEFF.
  • LevelControl cluster CurrentLevel (AttributeID 0x0000) has a type of uint8 and is nullable.
    ◦ AttributeValue of 0xA1 would be used as-is, as it is in range.
    ◦ AttributeValue of 0xBB12 is outside the range of nullable uint8, and would be considered as       the null value.
